A mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, which changes the new Magical Deceiver archetype!

Changes:
* Gives full spell level progression (replaced the progression with Wizard spells per day progression)
* Allow Deceiver spellbook to be merged with every Mythic spellbook
* Adds these spells to the Deceiver spell list
  * Hellfire Ray
  * Magic Missile (doesn't work as well for merging as you would think)
  * Energy Drain
  * Ill Omen
  * Glitterdust
  * Polar Ray
  * Waves of Exhaustion
  * Waves of Fatigue
  * Tidal Wave
  * Angelic Aspect /Greater
  * False Life /Greater
  * Heroism /Greater
  * Magic Weapon /Greater
  * Haste

KNOWN ISSUES:
* Damage spells above spell level 6 deal 1 damage
  * Deceiver currently has a hard damage dice cap at spell level 6 for merged spells, and I don't care enough to fix it
  * Thus, all spells I had that are higher then spell level 6 will go into spell level 6
  * Doesn't help merged mythic damage spells, but you can use Toybox to move those spells into level 6

Future plans:
* Perhaps spells from other mods? 
* 10% chance of adding configurable settings
* ???
