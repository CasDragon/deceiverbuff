A mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, which changes the new Magical Deceiver archetype!

Changes:
* Gives full spell level progression (spell list only goes up to level 6, but merged spellbooks will add the higher level spells which can then be cast)

Future plans:
* Add spellbook merging to all mythic spellbooks
* ???
