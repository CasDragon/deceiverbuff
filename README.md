A mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, which changes the new Magical Deceiver archetype!

Changes:
* Gives full spell level progression (replaced the progression with Wizard spells per day progression)
* Allow Deceiver spellbook to be merged with every Mythic spellbook
* Allows merged spell level 7 and higher spells to properly deal damage
* Adds cantrips to Deceiver
  * Jolt
  * Acid Splash
  * Ray of Frost
* Adds these spells to the Deceiver spell list
  * Hellfire Ray
  * Magic Missile (doesn't work as well for merging as you would think)
  * Energy Drain
  * Ill Omen
  * Glitterdust
  * Polar Ray
  * Waves of Exhaustion
  * Waves of Fatigue
  * Tidal Wave
  * Angelic Aspect /Greater
  * False Life /Greater
  * Heroism /Greater
  * Magic Weapon /Greater
  * Haste
  * Communal Protection From Evil / Chaos
  * Dragonkind 1/2/3, Red / Gold
  

KNOWN ISSUES:
* None hopefully?

Future plans:
* Perhaps spells from other mods? 
* 10% chance of adding configurable settings
* ???
